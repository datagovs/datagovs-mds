## Understanding MDS 
________________________________________________________

Analysts and Engineers working for Operators (or Cities) can use MDS to share data using several endpoints, while DataGovs on top of MDS
for Compliance monitoring simplifies integrating this into your apps to track compliance and costs in a data warehouse. 

These "APIs" and "Endpoints" form the MDS project. With MDS Compliance Monitoring, "Operators or Cities" can ensure the quality of your data
through testing and validation for free on iOS or Android.
